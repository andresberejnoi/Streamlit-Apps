# Housing Price Visualizations

This web application uses the Californian housing data from the third edition of the book ["Hands-On Machine Learning With Scikit-Learn, Keras, And Tensorflow"](https://amzn.to/3pC2A5b) by Aurélien Géron. I can't recommend this book enough for those looking to build a solid foundation on machine learning and machine learning frameworks (the link is a referral link).
